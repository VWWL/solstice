# Solsticio Plugin Framework

Inspired by Eclipse Equinox and Trello Power-Ups, **Solsticio** is a plugin framework to enable 3rd parties 
adding extra functionalities to your application via safe sandboxes.  The whole idea is that you have a 
set of pre-defined "capabilities" or "extension points", to which others can contribute additional functionalities 
without touching your codebase (importing type definition files may be required).
